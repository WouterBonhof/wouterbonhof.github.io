After an adventure-filled, international career in archaeology I decided it was time for a change. Looking for a more stable career, though still with international opportunities, I changed my focus to data analysis ðŸ“Š

I have never been afraid to get my hands dirty and really dig into a topic. This also means I don't shy away from doing a lot of leg work, as long as there is a clear goal in mind or if the topic appeals to my hunger for knowledge. 

As with archaeology, data is in the end all about the story. Not everyone has the time and patience to examine tables and graphs, looking for its value and implications. Over the years I have gained excellent experience at crafting stories from data, which I now want to apply in a more commercial setting.
