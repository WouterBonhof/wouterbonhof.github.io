After an adventure-filled, international career in archaeology I decided it was time for a change. Looking for a more stable career, though still with international opportunities, I changed my focus to data analysis ðŸ“Š

Throughout my life I have never been afraid to get my hands dirty and really dig into a topic. I always want to better understand the world around me and find the hidden information and implications.

As with archaeology, data is in the end all about the story. Not everyone has the time and patience to examine tables and graphs, looking for its value and implications. Over the years I have gained excellent experience at crafting stories from data, which I now want to apply in a more commercial setting.
