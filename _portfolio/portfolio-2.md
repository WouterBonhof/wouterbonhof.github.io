During my Data Traineeship at House of BÃ¨ta I took part in the course 'Datamodelleren' by Jan Meeuwsen. 
A key component of the course was the design of a complete datamodel. We were free to pick any topic and I decided to design a datamodel for a fictional organisation 'Grafzerken Nederland'. 
The resulting model was well received by the instructor and was graded an 8,4 out of 10.
